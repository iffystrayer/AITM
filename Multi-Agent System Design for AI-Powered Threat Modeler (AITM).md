## Multi-Agent System Design for AI-Powered Threat Modeler (AITM)

## 1. Rationale for Multi-Agent Approach

*   **Specialization:** Allows agents to become experts in specific domains (e.g., system architecture, ATT&CK mapping, control evaluation), leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.
*   **Modularity:** Easier to update, replace, or add new capabilities (agents) without affecting the entire system.
*   **Improved Reasoning:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks for individual agents can lead to more coherent and less "hallucinated" outputs from the LLMs.
*   **Parallelization:** Some tasks can be executed in parallel by different agents, speeding up the overall process.
*   **Robustness:** Failure in one agent's reasoning might be mitigated by cross-verification or alternative approaches from other agents.
*   **Auditability:** Easier to trace which agent produced which part of the output, aiding debugging and validation.

## 2. High-Level Multi-Agent Architecture

The core AITM services remain, but the "Orchestration Engine" and "LLM Integration Service" now become a more sophisticated "Agent Orchestrator" managing a "Team of Agents."

## 3. Core Agent Types and Roles

Each agent will have a defined persona, specific goals, a set of tools it can use, and access to a shared knowledge base and context.

    *   **Output:** Prioritized list of mitigation recommendations, including specific actions and links to best practices.

## 4. Agent Capabilities: Tools & Knowledge

Each agent will leverage the existing AITM services as "tools" they can call:

*   **Internal Tools:**
    *   **Knowledge Base (ATT&CK DB) Access:** Direct querying of ATT&CK data.
    *   **Semantic Search / RAG Service:** For retrieving contextual information from unstructured data (system docs, policies, threat intelligence reports).
    *   **Data Ingestion Service Interface:** To pull raw input data about the system.
    *   **Shared Context Read/Write:** Ability to read from and write to the shared memory.
    *   **Internal LLM Integration:** Each agent's "thinking" engine, capable of reasoning, parsing, and generating text/JSON.

*   **External Tools (accessed via API/Service Layer):**
    *   Threat Intelligence Feeds
    *   Vulnerability Databases (CVEs)
    *   Potentially, integration with security tools (e.g., CMDB, EDR, WAF) for real-time control posture.

## 5. Inter-Agent Communication & Collaboration

*   **Shared Context (Blackboard Pattern):**
    *   A central, evolving data structure (e.g., a structured JSON document or a small database) representing the current state of the threat model.
    *   Agents write their findings and updates to this shared context.
    *   Agents read from this context to get the latest information needed for their tasks.
    *   The Master Orchestrator Agent is responsible for managing consistency and versions of the shared context.
    *   **Example Context:**
        ```json
        {
          "system_description": "...",
          "identified_assets": [...],
          "identified_technologies": [...],
          "potential_entry_points": [...],
          "threat_actors_of_interest": [...],
          "attack_paths": [
            {
              "id": "path_1",
              "sequence": ["T1190", "T1059.003", "T1078"],
              "priority_score": 0.8,
              "explanation": "...",
              "current_control_coverage": { ... },
              "control_gaps": [...]
            }
          ],
          "control_evaluation_results": [...],
          "mitigation_recommendations": [...]
        }
        ```

*   **Message Passing:**
    *   Agents communicate primarily through the Master Orchestrator Agent.
    *   The MOA sends specific requests/tasks to specialized agents (e.g., "SAA, analyze this system description and identify assets.").
    *   Specialized agents send their outputs/results back to the MOA.
    *   **Format:** Standardized messages (e.g., JSON) defining the sender, receiver, task, input parameters, and expected output format.

*   **Feedback Loops:**
    *   MOA reviews agent outputs. If an output seems incomplete or incorrect, it can request clarification or re-execution from the agent, or even pass it to another agent for validation.
    *   Agents can indicate uncertainty in their output, prompting the MOA to seek additional input or validation.

## 6. Orchestration & Workflow (MOA-Driven Example)

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   User inputs system details to UI.
    *   API Gateway forwards to MOA.
    *   MOA initializes Shared Context with raw system data.

2.  **System Understanding (SAA):**
    *   MOA sends task: "SAA, analyze raw system data from Shared Context. Identify assets, technologies, and entry points. Update Shared Context."
    *   SAA uses Data Ingestion and Semantic Search tools.
    *   SAA writes findings to Shared Context.

3.  **Threat Intelligence Context (TIA - Parallel to SAA or next):**
    *   MOA sends task: "TIA, given identified technologies and industry (from SAA's output in Shared Context), identify relevant threat actors and their common TTPs. Update Shared Context."
    *   TIA uses external TI feeds and ATT&CK DB.
    *   TIA writes findings to Shared Context.

4.  **ATT&CK Mapping & Attack Path Generation (AMA):**
    *   MOA sends task: "AMA, using identified assets, entry points (from SAA), and relevant TTPs (from TIA), generate plausible attack paths using MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Update Shared Context."
    *   AMA uses ATT&CK DB and Attack Graph Builder.
    *   AMA writes attack paths to Shared Context.

5.  **Control Evaluation (CEA):**
    *   MOA sends task: "CEA, for each attack path (from AMA in Shared Context) and given existing security control documentation (via Semantic Search), evaluate control coverage and identify gaps. Update Shared Context."
    *   CEA uses Semantic Search (for control docs) and ATT&CK DB (for mitigations).
    *   CEA writes control evaluations and gaps to Shared Context.

6.  **Mitigation Recommendation (MRA):**
    *   MOA sends task: "MRA, for each identified control gap and prioritized attack path (from CEA and TIA), generate specific mitigation recommendations. Update Shared Context."
    *   MRA uses ATT&CK DB (mitigations) and Semantic Search (best practices).
    *   MRA writes recommendations to Shared Context.

7.  **Finalization & Reporting:**
    *   MOA gathers all processed data from Shared Context.
    *   MOA instructs Analytics & Reporting Service to generate final reports and visualizations.
    *   MOA returns summary results to API Gateway for UI display.

## 7. Challenges & Considerations

*   **Prompt Engineering Complexity:** Designing effective prompts for each specialized agent, ensuring they stay in character and leverage their specific tools correctly.
*   **Context Window Management:** Even with RAG, managing the growing shared context to fit within LLM context windows can be challenging. Summarization and intelligent chunking are vital.
*   **Inter-Agent Communication Overhead:** Ensuring efficient communication without creating bottlenecks or excessive token usage.
*   **Consistency & Coherence:** Making sure the combined outputs from multiple agents form a coherent and non-contradictory threat model. MOA's conflict resolution is key.
*   **Debugging:** Tracing issues across multiple interacting agents can be more complex than in a monolithic system.
*   **Performance:** Latency from multiple LLM calls can add up. Parallel execution helps.
*   **Cost:** More LLM calls generally mean higher operational costs.
*   **Explainability:** How do we explain why a certain recommendation was made if it's the result of complex interactions between several agents? Logging agent thought processes helps.
*   **Human Oversight:** The system should always include a human-in-the-loop for final validation and expert adjustment. Feedback from human review can be used for continuous agent improvement.

This multi-agent design provides a powerful, flexible, and scalable approach to automate threat modeling, allowing the AITM system to handle more complex scenarios and produce higher-quality, more nuanced results by leveraging the specialized expertise of different AI agents.
