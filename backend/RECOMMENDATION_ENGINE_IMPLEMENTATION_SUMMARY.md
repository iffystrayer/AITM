## Usage Examples

```python
from app.services.code_analysis.recommendation_engine import RecommendationEngine
from app.services.code_analysis.base_analyzer import AnalysisContext

# Initialize engine
engine = RecommendationEngine()

# Configure thresholds
engine.configure({
    'min_duplicate_lines': 3,
    'min_similarity_threshold': 0.8,
    'max_complexity_threshold': 10
})

# Analyze code
context = AnalysisContext(
    project_id="my_project",
    file_path="example.py",
    file_content=code_content,
    language="python"
)

result = engine.analyze(context)

# Process recommendations
for issue in result.issues:
    print(f"Recommendation: {issue.description}")
    print(f"Severity: {issue.severity}")
    if issue.suggested_fix:
        print(f"Suggested fix: {issue.suggested_fix}")
```
