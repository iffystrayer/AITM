3. **Improve Authentication Testing:** Add comprehensive JWT validation and login flow tests

### Medium Priority üü°
4. **Enhance Security Audit Testing:** Add comprehensive security event logging tests
5. **Add API Security Tests:** Include input validation and security headers testing
6. **Database Security Testing:** Add tests for secure database access patterns
7. **Improve Test Success Rate:** Target >90% test success rate

### Low Priority üü¢
8. **Documentation Updates:** Update API documentation with security requirements
9. **Performance Testing:** Add load testing for authorization endpoints
10. **Monitoring Enhancement:** Add more detailed security metrics
