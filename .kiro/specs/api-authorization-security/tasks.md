# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix production JWT secret key validation
  - Modify `backend/app/core/auth.py` to validate SECRET_KEY environment variable in production
  - Add startup validation that fails if SECRET_KEY is missing in production environment
  - Add appropriate logging and error messages for configuration issues
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Implement secure object-level permission functions
  - Refactor `can_access_project` function in `backend/app/core/permissions.py` to enforce ownership-based access
  - Implement `can_modify_project` function with proper ownership and admin privilege checks
  - Implement `can_delete_project` function with strict ownership validation
  - Remove permissive default access that allows any user with VIEW_PROJECTS to see all projects
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Create explicit permission dependency factories
  - Implement `require_project_access` dependency factory that validates user can access specific project
  - Implement `require_project_modification` dependency factory that validates user can modify specific project
  - Implement `require_project_deletion` dependency factory that validates user can delete specific project
  - Replace fragile decorator logic with explicit user object passing
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Secure project creation endpoint
  - Add authorization check to `create_project` endpoint in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/projects.py`
  - Ensure only users with CREATE_PROJECTS permission can create projects
  - Validate user context and set proper ownership on created projects
  - Add comprehensive error handling for authorization failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 5. Secure project retrieval endpoints
  - Add authorization to `get_project` endpoint using proper permission validation
  - Add authorization to `list_projects` endpoint to only return projects user can access
  - Implement proper filtering based on ownership and admin privileges
  - Ensure 404 responses for projects user cannot access (security through obscurity)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 6. Secure project modification endpoints
  - Add authorization to `update_project` endpoint using `require_project_modification` dependency
  - Add authorization to `delete_project` endpoint using `require_project_deletion` dependency
  - Validate ownership before allowing modifications
  - Implement proper admin privilege checks for cross-user operations
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 7. Secure project input endpoints
  - Add authorization to `add_system_input` endpoint with project access validation
  - Add authorization to `get_project_inputs` endpoint with project access validation
  - Ensure users can only add/view inputs for projects they can access
  - Implement consistent error handling across all input endpoints
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 8. Secure analysis endpoints
  - Add authorization to `start_analysis` endpoint with project modification validation
  - Add authorization to `get_analysis_status` endpoint with project access validation
  - Add authorization to `get_analysis_results` endpoint with project access validation
  - Ensure analysis operations respect project ownership and permissions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 9. Add authorization unit tests
  - Write unit tests for `can_access_project` function with various ownership scenarios
  - Write unit tests for `can_modify_project` function with owner/admin/unauthorized users
  - Write unit tests for `can_delete_project` function with proper permission validation
  - Write unit tests for all permission dependency factories
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 10. Add API endpoint authorization integration tests
  - Write integration tests for all project endpoints with unauthorized access attempts
  - Write integration tests for cross-user data access prevention
  - Write integration tests for admin privilege scenarios
  - Write integration tests for production configuration validation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 11. Implement security audit logging
  - Add structured logging for all authorization decisions
  - Add logging for failed access attempts with user context
  - Add logging for admin privilege usage
  - Implement log rotation and security event monitoring capabilities
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
