# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical security vulnerabilities identified in the AITM platform audit, specifically focusing on implementing proper API authorization and fixing permissive data access patterns. The current system allows any authenticated user to access, modify, and delete all data in the system, which represents a critical security flaw that must be resolved immediately.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API endpoints to enforce proper authorization checks, so that users can only access resources they have permission to view or modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a request to any project API endpoint THEN the system SHALL verify the user has appropriate permissions before processing the request
2. WHEN a user attempts to access a project they don't own THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error unless they have admin privileges
3. WHEN a user attempts to modify a project they don't own THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error unless they have admin privileges
4. WHEN a user attempts to delete a project they don't own THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error unless they have admin privileges

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want my project data to be isolated from other users, so that only I and authorized administrators can access my sensitive threat modeling information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to view projects THEN the system SHALL only return projects they own or have been explicitly granted access to
2. WHEN a user has VIEW_PROJECTS permission THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically grant access to all projects in the system
3. WHEN an admin user requests project access THEN the system SHALL allow access based on their elevated privileges
4. WHEN a regular user requests project access THEN the system SHALL verify ownership or explicit permission grants

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the permission checking system to be robust and explicit, so that authorization logic is clear and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system checks permissions THEN it SHALL use explicit user object passing rather than fragile decorator logic
2. WHEN permission checks are performed THEN the system SHALL clearly identify the user context without relying on implicit parameter discovery
3. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating insufficient permissions
4. WHEN new API endpoints are added THEN they SHALL be required to implement authorization checks by default

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want JWT secret key handling to be secure in production, so that user sessions remain valid across deployments and the system is cryptographically secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts in production THEN it SHALL require the SECRET_KEY environment variable to be set
2. WHEN the SECRET_KEY is missing in production THEN the application SHALL fail to start with a clear error message
3. WHEN the SECRET_KEY is properly configured THEN user sessions SHALL remain valid across application restarts
4. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system MAY generate a temporary key with appropriate warnings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want authorization to be implemented at multiple layers, so that the system has defense in depth against unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing authorization THEN the system SHALL check permissions at the API endpoint level
2. WHEN implementing authorization THEN the system SHALL check permissions at the service layer level
3. WHEN implementing authorization THEN the system SHALL validate object-level permissions for resource access
4. WHEN authorization is bypassed at one layer THEN other layers SHALL still enforce security controls
