# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive system validation of the completed API Authorization Security implementation, followed by strategic planning for the next development phase. The goal is to ensure the current system is production-ready while establishing a clear roadmap for future enhancements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive System Validation

**User Story:** As a development team, I want to validate that the API authorization security system is fully functional and production-ready, so that I can confidently deploy it and identify any remaining issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the E2E test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL pass all authorization security tests with 100% success rate
2. WHEN Docker containers are validated THEN the system SHALL confirm proper container setup and network configuration
3. WHEN TDD practices are evaluated THEN the system SHALL demonstrate comprehensive test coverage for all security components
4. WHEN production readiness is assessed THEN the system SHALL validate JWT configuration, database connections, and security audit logging
5. IF any test failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reporting and remediation steps

### Requirement 2: System Architecture Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer and stakeholder, I want to understand the current system architecture and security implementation, so that I can make informed decisions about future development and maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN architecture documentation is requested THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive overview of all security layers
2. WHEN component relationships are analyzed THEN the system SHALL show clear data flow and authorization checkpoints
3. WHEN security controls are reviewed THEN the system SHALL document all implemented security measures and their interactions
4. WHEN technical decisions are examined THEN the system SHALL explain the rationale behind key architectural choices
5. IF architecture gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL highlight areas for potential improvement

### Requirement 3: Next Feature Planning and Prioritization

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to identify and prioritize the next features to develop for the AITM platform, so that I can maximize business value and user experience improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feature opportunities are assessed THEN the system SHALL identify potential enhancements based on current capabilities
2. WHEN business value is evaluated THEN the system SHALL prioritize features by impact and implementation complexity
3. WHEN technical feasibility is analyzed THEN the system SHALL consider existing architecture and security constraints
4. WHEN user experience is considered THEN the system SHALL identify features that improve platform usability
5. IF multiple feature options exist THEN the system SHALL provide a ranked recommendation with justification

### Requirement 4: Production Deployment Readiness Assessment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to understand the production deployment requirements and steps for the API authorization security system, so that I can ensure a smooth and secure deployment process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment requirements are reviewed THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive deployment checklist
2. WHEN environment configuration is assessed THEN the system SHALL validate all necessary environment variables and secrets
3. WHEN security considerations are evaluated THEN the system SHALL confirm production security configurations
4. WHEN monitoring and logging are reviewed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper observability is in place
5. IF deployment risks are identified THEN the system SHALL provide mitigation strategies and rollback procedures
