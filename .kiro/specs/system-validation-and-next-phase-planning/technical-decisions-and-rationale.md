# Technical Decisions and Architecture Rationale

## Executive Summary

This document captures the key architectural decisions made during the implementation of the AITM API Authorization Security system. Each decision is documented with its rationale, alternatives considered, trade-offs evaluated, and long-term implications. These decisions form the foundation of a secure, scalable, and maintainable threat modeling platform.

## Decision Framework

All architectural decisions were evaluated against the following criteria:
- **Security**: Does this enhance or maintain system security?
- **Scalability**: Can this approach handle growth in users and data?
- **Maintainability**: Is this solution easy to understand and modify?
- **Performance**: Does this provide acceptable system performance?
- **Compliance**: Does this meet security and regulatory requirements?

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Multi-Layered Security Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a four-layer security architecture (API, Service, Data, JWT layers) with defense-in-depth principles.

**Rationale**:
- **Security Requirement**: Threat modeling data is highly sensitive and requires comprehensive protection
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Multi-layered approach meets enterprise security standards
- **Risk Mitigation**: Multiple validation points prevent single points of failure
- **Audit Requirements**: Each layer provides independent logging and monitoring

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Single-Layer Security**: Implement security only at API gateway level
   - *Rejected*: Insufficient protection for sensitive data
   - *Risk*: Single point of failure for entire security model

2. **Two-Layer Security**: API and database-level security only
   - *Rejected*: Missing business logic security validation
   - *Risk*: Service layer vulnerabilities unprotected

3. **Framework-Only Security**: Rely solely on FastAPI security features
   - *Rejected*: Insufficient granular control for complex authorization
   - *Risk*: Limited customization for threat modeling requirements

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Comprehensive security coverage, defense-in-depth, audit compliance
- **Cons**: Increased complexity, potential performance overhead, more code to maintain
- **Mitigation**: Clear separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, performance monitoring

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# Layer 1: API Security
@router.post("/projects")
async def create_project(
    current_user: User = Depends(require_permission(Permission.CREATE_PROJECTS))
):
    # Layer 2: Service Security
    if not can_modify_project(current_user, project):
        raise HTTPException(403, "Insufficient permissions")
    
    # Layer 3: Data Security
    project.owner_user_id = current_user.id
    
    # Layer 4: JWT Security (handled in dependencies)
```

### Decision 2: Ownership-Based Access Control with Admin Override

**Decision**: Implement strict ownership-based access control where users can only access resources they own, with administrative override capabilities.

**Rationale**:
- **Data Privacy**: Threat modeling data contains sensitive organizational information
- **Compliance**: Meets data protection requirements for multi-tenant systems
- **Security Principle**: Principle of least privilege enforced by default
- **Business Logic**: Aligns with typical organizational security models

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Permissive Default Access**: Allow users with VIEW_PROJECTS to see all projects
   - *Rejected*: Violates data privacy principles
   - *Risk*: Unauthorized access to sensitive threat modeling data

2. **Team-Based Access Only**: Implement only team-based sharing without ownership
   - *Rejected*: Overly complex for initial implementation
   - *Risk*: Difficult to manage permissions at scale

3. **Role-Based Access Only**: Grant access based purely on user roles
   - *Rejected*: Insufficient granularity for resource-level security
   - *Risk*: Over-privileged access for users

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Strong data privacy, clear ownership model, compliance-friendly
- **Cons**: Potential collaboration limitations, admin overhead for shared access
- **Mitigation**: Future team-based sharing features, clear admin override policies

**Implementation Details**:
```python
def can_access_project(user: User, project) -> bool:
    # Ownership check first
    if project.owner_user_id == user.id:
        return True
    
    # Admin override
    if user.role in [Role.ADMIN.value, Role.SUPER_ADMIN.value]:
        return True
    
    # Deny by default - no permissive fallback
    return False
```

### Decision 3: JWT-Based Authentication with Production Security Validation

**Decision**: Use JWT tokens for authentication with comprehensive production security validation and environment-specific configuration.

**Rationale**:
- **Stateless Authentication**: JWT tokens enable stateless authentication suitable for API-first architecture
- **Scalability**: No server-side session storage required, supports horizontal scaling
- **Security Standards**: Industry-standard approach with proven security model
- **Production Hardening**: Comprehensive validation prevents common JWT vulnerabilities

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Session-Based Authentication**: Traditional server-side session management
   - *Rejected*: Requires session storage, complicates horizontal scaling
   - *Risk*: Session management complexity, storage requirements

2. **API Key Authentication**: Simple API key-based authentication
   - *Rejected*: Insufficient for user-based authorization requirements
   - *Risk*: Limited user context, difficult key rotation

3. **OAuth 2.0 Integration**: External OAuth provider integration
   - *Rejected*: Adds external dependency, complexity for initial implementation
   - *Future Consideration*: May be added for enterprise integration

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Stateless, scalable, industry standard, flexible
- **Cons**: Token management complexity, potential security risks if misconfigured
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive production validation, secure key management, proper expiration

**Implementation Details**:
```python
def validate_production_config():
    if environment == "production":
        if not secret_key or len(secret_key) < 32:
            raise RuntimeError("SECRET_KEY too weak for production")
        
        if secret_key.lower() in weak_keys:
            raise RuntimeError("SECRET_KEY appears to be default/weak value")
```

### Decision 4: Role-Based Permission System with Granular Controls

**Decision**: Implement a hierarchical role-based permission system with granular permission controls and explicit permission dependencies.

**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: Granular permissions allow fine-tuned access control
- **Scalability**: Role hierarchy reduces permission management overhead
- **Security**: Explicit permissions prevent accidental over-privileging
- **Maintainability**: Clear role definitions simplify user management

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Simple Role-Based Access**: Basic roles without granular permissions
   - *Rejected*: Insufficient flexibility for complex authorization requirements
   - *Risk*: Over-privileged or under-privileged users

2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Complex attribute-based system
   - *Rejected*: Overly complex for current requirements
   - *Risk*: Implementation complexity, performance overhead

3. **Resource-Based Permissions Only**: Permissions tied directly to resources
   - *Rejected*: Difficult to manage at scale
   - *Risk*: Permission explosion, management complexity

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Flexible, scalable, clear hierarchy, granular control
- **Cons**: Initial complexity, requires careful permission design
- **Mitigation**: Clear role definitions, comprehensive testing, documentation

**Implementation Details**:
```python
ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
    Role.SUPER_ADMIN: {
        Permission.CREATE_PROJECTS,
        Permission.VIEW_PROJECTS,
        Permission.EDIT_PROJECTS,
        Permission.DELETE_PROJECTS,
        Permission.MANAGE_USERS,
        # ... all permissions
    },
    Role.ANALYST: {
        Permission.CREATE_PROJECTS,
        Permission.VIEW_PROJECTS,
        Permission.EDIT_PROJECTS,
        Permission.RUN_ANALYSIS,
        # ... analyst-specific permissions
    }
}
```

### Decision 5: Comprehensive Security Audit Logging

**Decision**: Implement structured security audit logging for all authentication, authorization, and resource access events.

**Rationale**:
- **Compliance**: Security audit trails required for enterprise compliance
- **Incident Response**: Detailed logs essential for security incident investigation
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring requires structured event data
- **Forensics**: Comprehensive audit trail supports forensic analysis

**Alternatives Considered**:

@dataclass
class SecurityEvent:
    event_type: SecurityEventType
    user_id: Optional[str] = None
    user_role: Optional[str] = None
    resource_type: Optional[str] = None
    resource_id: Optional[str] = None
    result: Optional[str] = None
    error_code: Optional[str] = None

def log_project_access_denied(self, user_id: str, project_id: str, error_code: str):
    event = SecurityEvent(
        event_type=SecurityEventType.PROJECT_ACCESS_DENIED,
        user_id=user_id,
        resource_id=project_id,
        error_code=error_code
    )
    self.log_event(event, f"Project {project_id} access denied for user {user_id}")
