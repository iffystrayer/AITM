- Admin privilege checks for elevated access
- Query-level filtering based on user permissions
- SQLAlchemy-based secure database interactions

#### Layer 4: JWT Security Layer
- Secure token creation, validation, and lifecycle management
- Production secret validation with 32+ character requirements
- HS256 algorithm with secure key management
- Configurable token expiration (30 min access, 7 days refresh)

### 2.2 Component Relationships and Data Flows

#### Core System Architecture
```
Frontend (SvelteKit) ‚Üí API Gateway (FastAPI) ‚Üí Authentication Layer ‚Üí 
Authorization Layer ‚Üí Service Layer ‚Üí Data Layer (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
```

#### Security Context Flow
1. **Client Request**: Frontend sends request with JWT token
2. **Token Validation**: API validates JWT signature and expiration
3. **User Context**: Service layer extracts user information
4. **Permission Check**: RBAC system validates user permissions
5. **Resource Access**: Data layer applies ownership-based filtering
6. **Audit Logging**: Security events logged for monitoring

### 2.3 Technical Decisions and Rationale

#### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Multi-Layered Security**: Defense-in-depth with four independent security layers
2. **Ownership-Based Access Control**: Strict resource ownership with admin override
3. **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication for scalability
4. **Role-Based Permissions**: Hierarchical role system with granular controls
5. **Security Through Obscurity**: 404 responses for unauthorized access attempts

#### Technology Stack Rationale
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async framework with type safety
- **SQLAlchemy**: Async ORM with strong type safety and flexibility
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Development simplicity with production scalability
- **JWT Tokens**: Industry-standard stateless authentication
