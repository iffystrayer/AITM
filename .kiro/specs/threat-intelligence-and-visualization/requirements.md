# Threat Intelligence Integration & Interactive Visualization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification covers the development of two interconnected features that will transform AITM from a static threat modeling tool into a dynamic, real-time threat intelligence platform with rich interactive visualizations. These features work synergistically to provide users with up-to-date threat context and intuitive visual representations of complex security relationships.

3. WHEN risk levels change THEN the heat map SHALL update colors and intensity in real-time
4. WHEN multiple risk dimensions exist THEN the user SHALL be able to switch between different heat map views
5. WHEN a user clicks on high-risk areas THEN the system SHALL provide drill-down capabilities to specific threats
6. WHEN generating heat maps THEN the system SHALL use colorblind-friendly color schemes
7. WHEN heat map data is complex THEN the system SHALL provide legend and scale indicators

### Requirement 5: Attack Path Flow Diagrams

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to visualize potential attack paths as flow diagrams so that I can understand how threats might propagate through systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attack path data exists THEN the system SHALL generate directed flow diagrams showing threat progression
2. WHEN a user traces an attack path THEN the system SHALL highlight the complete path from entry to impact
3. WHEN multiple attack paths exist THEN the user SHALL be able to compare different scenarios side-by-side
4. WHEN attack paths are complex THEN the system SHALL provide path simplification and grouping options
5. WHEN a user selects path elements THEN the system SHALL display mitigation recommendations
6. WHEN attack paths change THEN the diagrams SHALL update automatically to reflect new intelligence
7. WHEN paths involve multiple systems THEN the visualization SHALL clearly show system boundaries

### Requirement 6: Threat Intelligence Dashboard

**User Story:** As a security operations center analyst, I want a dedicated dashboard for threat intelligence so that I can monitor threat landscape changes in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the threat intelligence dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current threat feed status
2. WHEN new high-priority threats are detected THEN the dashboard SHALL prominently highlight them
3. WHEN threat trends change THEN the dashboard SHALL display trend analysis and historical comparisons
4. WHEN multiple threat sources provide conflicting information THEN the dashboard SHALL indicate confidence levels
5. WHEN dashboard data is older than 10 minutes THEN the system SHALL display staleness warnings
6. WHEN a user customizes dashboard layout THEN the system SHALL persist user preferences
7. WHEN dashboard alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL provide one-click investigation workflows

### Requirement 7: Threat Correlation and Analysis

**User Story:** As a threat intelligence analyst, I want the system to automatically correlate threat data with existing projects so that I can identify relevant threats for specific assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new threat intelligence arrives THEN the system SHALL automatically correlate it with existing threat models
2. WHEN correlations are found THEN the system SHALL notify relevant project stakeholders
3. WHEN correlation confidence is low THEN the system SHALL flag items for manual review
4. WHEN threats match multiple projects THEN the system SHALL prioritize notifications based on project criticality
5. WHEN correlation rules are updated THEN the system SHALL reprocess recent threat data
6. WHEN false positives are identified THEN the system SHALL learn and improve correlation accuracy
