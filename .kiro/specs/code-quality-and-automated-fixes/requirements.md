### Requirement 3: Code Quality Issue Tracking

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want systematic tracking of code quality issues so that I can prioritize technical debt and improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality issues are identified THEN the system SHALL create trackable items
2. WHEN issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL update tracking status
3. WHEN quality trends worsen THEN the system SHALL escalate priority
4. IF critical issues are found THEN the system SHALL block deployments
5. WHEN quality improvements are made THEN the system SHALL measure impact
6. WHEN technical debt accumulates THEN the system SHALL recommend refactoring
7. WHEN quality gates are defined THEN the system SHALL enforce them

### Requirement 4: Refactoring and Improvement Recommendations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent recommendations for code improvements so that I can systematically enhance code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements
2. WHEN duplicate code is detected THEN the system SHALL recommend consolidation
3. WHEN performance issues are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest optimizations
4. IF security vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize fixes
5. WHEN architectural improvements are possible THEN the system SHALL recommend changes
6. WHEN dependencies are outdated THEN the system SHALL suggest updates
7. WHEN best practices are violated THEN the system SHALL provide guidance

### Requirement 5: Quality Metrics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want a dashboard showing code quality metrics so that I can track team performance and project health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current quality metrics
2. WHEN metrics change THEN the dashboard SHALL update in real-time
3. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL show trends over time
4. IF quality targets are set THEN the dashboard SHALL show progress toward goals
5. WHEN team comparisons are needed THEN the system SHALL provide comparative metrics
6. WHEN quality reports are generated THEN they SHALL be exportable
7. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the dashboard SHALL highlight critical issues

### Requirement 6: Automated Testing Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated assessment of test quality so that I can ensure comprehensive test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are written THEN the system SHALL analyze test quality
2. WHEN test coverage drops THEN the system SHALL identify uncovered code
3. WHEN test patterns are suboptimal THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements
4. IF tests are flaky THEN the system SHALL identify and flag them
5. WHEN test performance degrades THEN the system SHALL recommend optimizations
6. WHEN test maintenance is needed THEN the system SHALL prioritize updates
7. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL ensure test coverage

### Requirement 7: Code Review Automation

**User Story:** As a code reviewer, I want automated pre-review checks so that I can focus on logic and architecture rather than style issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL run automated checks
2. WHEN style issues exist THEN the system SHALL auto-fix before review
3. WHEN quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL block merge until resolved
4. IF security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL require security review
5. WHEN complexity thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL flag for review
6. WHEN documentation is missing THEN the system SHALL require updates
7. WHEN breaking changes are made THEN the system SHALL ensure proper versioning

### Requirement 8: Continuous Quality Improvement

**User Story:** As a development team, I want continuous quality improvement processes so that code quality consistently improves over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality baselines are established THEN the system SHALL track improvements
2. WHEN quality regressions occur THEN the system SHALL identify root causes
3. WHEN improvement opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL create action items
4. IF quality goals are met THEN the system SHALL set new targets
5. WHEN team practices change THEN the system SHALL adapt quality standards
6. WHEN tools are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain quality consistency
7. WHEN quality training is needed THEN the system SHALL recommend resources

### Requirement 9: Integration with Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want quality tools integrated into my development workflow so that quality checks don't disrupt productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria
