## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive specification for the design, development, and deployment of the AI-Powered Threat Modeler (AITM) system. AITM aims to automate and enhance the cybersecurity threat modeling process by leveraging advanced LLM capabilities within a multi-agent architecture, integrated with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This system will enable organizations to proactively identify, analyze, and mitigate potential cyber threats with greater efficiency, consistency, and depth than manual methods.

### 1.2. Scope
The AITM system will:
*   Ingest diverse input data describing target systems, applications, and networks.
*   Automate the identification of critical assets and system components.
*   Dynamically map system characteristics and potential vulnerabilities to MITRE ATT&CK tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques.
*   Construct plausible attack paths/chains based on identified techniques and adversary behaviors.
*   Evaluate existing security controls against identified threats and pinpoint gaps.
*   Generate prioritized, actionable mitigation recommendations aligned with ATT&CK mitigations and cybersecurity best practices.
*   Provide a user interface for system definition, progress monitoring, and results visualization.
*   Generate comprehensive reports of the threat modeling analysis.

This initial scope does **not** include:
*   Automated remediation/enforcement of security controls.
*   Real-time security monitoring (beyond leveraging existing control documentation).
*   Direct integration with live security tools for dynamic configuration changes.
*   Deep packet inspection or highly granular network traffic analysis for threat detection.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1. Product Perspective
AITM is a standalone, cloud-native application designed to integrate into an organization's existing cybersecurity ecosystem. It consumes system data as input and produces threat models and mitigation reports as output. It complements existing vulnerability scanners, SIEMs, and GRC tools by providing a proactive, adversary-centric view of security posture.

### 2.2. Product Functions
The primary functions of the AITM system are:
*   **System Definition:** Allow users to input details about the system to be modeled.
*   **Intelligent Analysis:** Use LLMs to analyze system descriptions, identify assets, and infer potential attack surface.
*   **ATT&CK Mapping:** Map system characteristics to relevant ATT&CK techniques.
*   **Attack Path Generation:** Construct logical sequences of ATT&CK techniques representing potential attack flows.
*   **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Incorporate real-world threat actor TTPs to contextualize and prioritize threats.
*   **Control Gap Identification:** Evaluate existing security controls against identified threats.
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:** Generate actionable recommendations to address identified gaps.
*   **Reporting & Visualization:** Present threat model results in an understandable and exportable format.
*   **Agent Orchestration:** Manage the workflow and communication among specialized AI agents.

### 2.3. User Characteristics
*   **Cybersecurity Analysts/Engineers:** Primary users, responsible for defining systems, reviewing threat models, and implementing mitigations. They possess cybersecurity domain knowledge but may not be LLM experts.
*   **Security Architects:** Use the system for strategic security planning and design review.
*   **Compliance Officers:** May use reports for audit and compliance purposes.
*   **Developers/DevSecOps:** May input new application details and review specific code/system design related recommendations.

### 2.4. General Constraints
*   **Performance:** Threat modeling for moderately complex systems should complete within minutes (e.g., 5-15 minutes). LLM response times are a critical factor.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle multiple concurrent threat modeling sessions.
*   **Accuracy:** LLM outputs must be grounded in factual data (via RAG) and consistent with cybersecurity principles and the ATT&CK framework. Hallucinations must be minimized.
*   **Security:** Adherence to robust security practices for data handling, API security, and protection against prompt injection.
*   **Cost Efficiency:** Optimize LLM token usage and computational resources.
*   **Maintainability:** Modular architecture to allow for easy updates to LLM models, ATT&CK data, and agent logic.
*   **Usability:** Intuitive UI for input and result interpretation.

### 2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies
*   **LLM API Availability:** Stable access to reliable and performant LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini).
*   **MITRE ATT&CK Data:** Ongoing availability of the official MITRE ATT&CK framework data (STIX/JSON).
*   **Domain Expertise:** Human review and validation will always be part of the final threat modeling process; the system automates *assistance*, not full replacement.
*   **Input Data Quality:** The quality of the threat model is highly dependent on the accuracy and completeness of the input system data provided by the user.
*   **Computational Resources:** Sufficient compute and memory resources for running vector databases, graph databases, and potentially local embedding models.
